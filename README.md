# Front-end code assignment for sport-compas

Done only front-end part without backend and database. I simulated with news api how should it look if i received data from backend via API (so data in items is fake).

Item actions, display of selected items inside modal would idealy go with some backend involved, instead i decided to go straight inside modal (because there is no backend involved), other solution could be to go with localStorage if i had routing.

Initialy had some problems with initialising jquery so i wrote everithing in vanilla js, but later i figured there was some conflict with namespace so i didn't want to revert some parts.
